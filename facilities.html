	<h3>DAMINI: Sports And Recreation Activities Under The Realm Of MKSSS</h3>
	Maharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Samstha, (MKSSS), has taken a lead in sports activity and Damini came into existence in the year 2006-07. The Samstha insists each and every student to participate in games. Games improve their health and make them active.

Sports are the best way to keep our students happy and enthusiastic. It also refreshes their life, apart from that it gives a winning spirit. We teach our students to face the obstacles and hindrances coming in our day to day life through sports. Every one cannot become sports person but that winning attitude and the sportsmanship is very important. Indoor games are meant to build up concentration of our students and an outdoor game build up their strength and keep them fit.

DAMINI sports activity is meant exclusively for college students under Maharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Samstha.
