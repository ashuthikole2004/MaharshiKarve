<div class="row"><img src="image/bhaubeej-1.jpg"></div><br>
<h5>BHAUBEEJ Scheme</h5>
<p>Bhaubeej is a pious, healthy and beautiful relationship shared between a brother and a sister in which sister prays for good health and prosperity of a brother and brother helps for the upliftment of a sister and takes care for the whole life. The primary objective of this scheme is, the society can help girl students for their education by donating through this fund.</p>

Late Mr. G. M. Chiplunkar, who was a “Life Member” of this Samstha, started a unique scheme, in the year 1919. He started this scheme to collect the funds to provide financial support to needy girls coming from weaker section of the society, to  complete their education. The scheme was named as “Bhaubeej Fund Collection”. To run this scheme, he approached the girl students for collecting Bhaubeej Funds. Afterwards many volunteers came forward to participate in this scheme. They approached people who believe in social responsibility for getting financial support to needy girl students.

The scheme received a good response from the public for last 100 years.
The girls who cannot bear the expenses required for their stay and education, our Samstha always help them through the financial support from well wishers and philanthropists.</p>
